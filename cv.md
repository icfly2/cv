# Ruben Menke

I'm a data scientist interested in solving problems that matter and delivering solutions that impact. In the past I've contributed to projects that:
- help traders with predictions about the next days energy consumption and pricing.
- prioritise what cabels to replace in Copenhagen
- predict the probability of a payment being suspected of money laundering
- block payments to sanctioned parties while permitting payments to people that just have a name in common.
Generally I'm interested in applying nice maths and statistics to real world problems and taking the deliverable one step further, resulting in actions rather than papers.

    Data Scientist at Ørsted Jun 2017 - Dec 2018 Copenhagen, Denmark
            I work on machine learning and optimisation problems in the electricity supply sector. My role is split between providing tools and analysis to an operational department and working in a cross departmental advanced analytics team. 

            So far I've used a range of machine learning tools and statistics to tackle forecasting problems, for prices, energy volumes and asset failures.

            I've developed an optimisation tools for asset design and layout, asset operation and trading strategies.

            To enable more users in the organisation to access and understand the results I've led development of interfaces using Django, Flask, and jupyter.

            Additionally I've led the development of three internally used python packages, providing simulation and valuation capabilities, utilities and trading warning and guidance to various teams in the organisation. Furthermore I'm active in the optimisation reference group and have started a python user group, aiming to improve the coding practices across departments enabling the transition away from excel.I work on machine learning and optimisation problems in the electricity supply sector.

            Research into the optimal energy usage of urban water distribution systems. A city's water supply system can account for up to 5% of the total electricity consumption. I look at how the efficiency can be improved and how the share of renewable energy used can be increased by improving the operating schedule of the major pumps that drive the system. 

            My research focused on mathematical modeling of the real systems and using these models to develop innovative ways for the water and energy sector to interact. The main focus of this research was in applying optimal operational scheduling to make the water system a smart player in the modern electricity grid. As part of this I developed ways to represent a water distribution system such that optimal operating schedules can be computed efficiently.
